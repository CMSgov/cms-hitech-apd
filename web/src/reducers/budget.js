      /* ☝  What is that all about?
         We need to display the "Medicaid share" of all of these costs, broken
         down by state and federal share.  The Medicaid share is the total cost
         minus any "other funding" that the user entered into the cost
         allocation section.  The federal and state shares are dictated by which
         allocation the user selected - 90/10, 75/25, or 50/50 (federal/state).

         When the user is inputting data, the activity costs they enter combine
         to create the absolute total cost.  Thus, the state personnel,
         contractor, and non-personnel expense costs that we have available to
         us each include some portion of the "other funding."  We can't just
         use the values the user gave us.

         Instead, we compute how much of the absolute total cost each of those
         cost categories contribute.  Then we use those percentages to
         distribute the Medicaid share across the cost categories.  Here's
         an example:

         User Input:
            State personnel:  $400
            Contractors:      $500
            Non-personnel:    $100
            Other funding:    $200
            Cost allocation:  90/10
          
          Computed:
            Absolute total:   $1000:  sum of all costs
            Medicaid share:    $800:  Absolute total - other funding
            Federal share:     $720:  90% of Medicaid share
              State personnel: $288:  40% of federal share
              Contractors:     $360:  50% of federal share
              Non-personnel:    $72:  10% of federal share
            State share:        $80:  10% of Medicaid share
              State personnel:  $32:  40% of state share
              Contractors:      $40:  50% of state share
              Non-personnel:     $8:  10% of state share
